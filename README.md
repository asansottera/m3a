M3A: Marked MAP Matching Algorithms
===

(Under Construction)

Marked Markovian Arrival Processes (MMAPs) are a class of stochastic processes
used to model multi-class correlated arrivals athe arrivals at a queuing system.
M3A is a set of Matlab functions designed for computing the statistical descriptors
of MMAPs and fitting marked traces with MMAPs.

M3A is a joint work of Andrea Sansottera, Giuliano Casale and Paolo Cremonesi.
